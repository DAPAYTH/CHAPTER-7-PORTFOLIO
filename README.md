# CHAPTER-7-PORTFOLIO

Adding animation to an app can significantly enhance user experience by making interactions smoother and more engaging. In Flutter, there are two main types of animations: implicit and explicit. Implicit animations, such as AnimatedContainer and AnimatedOpacity, are easy to implement and automatically handle transitions between states, like changing size, color, or visibility. Explicit animations, using tools like AnimationController and Tween, provide more control, allowing developers to animate between custom values. Widgets like AnimatedPositioned and Hero create dynamic movement and smooth screen transitions. Animations not only improve aesthetics but also guide usersâ€™ attention, provide feedback, and create a more intuitive interface.
